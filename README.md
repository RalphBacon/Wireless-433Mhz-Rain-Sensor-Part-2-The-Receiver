# Wireless-433Mhz-Rain-Sensor-Part-2-The-Receiver
Oh no! It's raining and the washing (or cat) is still out! It's VERY easy to create a wireless rain sensor that communicates via a 433Mhz (or 315Mhz) wireless link giving you that all important heads-up that the weather has changed.

This is the receiver part of the project (still on breadboard as the custom case has not yet arrived) that receives via a 433Mhz link the temperature, the humidity, whether it's raining (and the level of rain falling) and the light level too just for good measure. Oh, and it has a capacitive touch sensor just for good measure. Well, why not?

If you haven't seen video #46 which describes the transmitter part (and before that video #44 which describes the thought processes that went on before building either component) I invite you to watch them now!

All code (sketches, links) for this part of the project can be found in this GitHub repository so just hit the DOWNLOAD button to get a zipped up package for you to unzip on your desktop and explore. Remember that sketches should be placed in a folder of the same name and libraries (if any are included here) go in the libraries folder within the Arduino IDE sketch folders.
